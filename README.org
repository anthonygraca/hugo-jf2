*This is not a standalone theme. This is a Hugo theme component.*

This component enables JF2 feeds for your site:

* Requirements
You need to install the latest version of Go from
https://go.dev/doc/install because this theme component requires [[https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/][~hugo
mod ..~ commands]] to work.

This update on switch to using Hugo Modules was last tested with Hugo
v0.92.0.
* Installing
1. Add this component as a new module to your site's TOML config file:
   #+begin_src conf-toml
   [module]
     [[module.imports]]
       path = "github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-jf2"
   #+end_src
2. Add "JF2Feed" to all the "list" Page Kinds for which you want to
   create JF2 feeds, and "JF2Post" to the "page" Page Kind:
   #+begin_src conf-toml
   [outputs]
     # <domain>/jf2feed.json
     home = ["HTML", "RSS", "JF2Feed"]     # default = ["HTML", "RSS"]
     # <domain>/posts/jf2feed.json
     section = ["HTML", "RSS", "JF2Feed"]  # default = ["HTML", "RSS"]
     # <domain>/tags/mytag/jf2feed.json, <domain>/categories/mycat/jf2feed.json
     taxonomy = ["HTML", "RSS", "JF2Feed"] # default = ["HTML", "RSS"]
     # <domain>/posts/mypost/jf2post.json
     page = ["HTML", "JF2Post"]            # default = ["HTML"]
   #+end_src
